# Introduction

Gradient descent is a important technique in the neural network to optimize the cost function. In order to understand it, we will first explain the high-level idea of gradient-descent, and then go through an example of applying it in the logistic regression.

# The Idea of Gradient Descent
Let us start with a function $$ y = f(\theta) $$
